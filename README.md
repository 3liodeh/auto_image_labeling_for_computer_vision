Let's say goodbye to manual labeling! dear data scientists and AI engineers, I've developed a core of the idea for automatic labeling using object tracking algorithms such as CSRT. The principle of the idea is to convert a dataset into a video, define the bounding box of the first frame, and let the code track the object in each subsequent frame, like the video has 500 images.
If the code detects a change in the object, it prompts you to draw a new bounding box and then in the end saves the frames and bounding boxes for all (frames) images in two files. 
I believe this method can revolutionize the way we label datasets, saving valuable time and resources for data scientists and AI engineers. And if you're interested in implementing this method yourself, don't hesitate to reach out or use it - I'm always happy to collaborate and modify the code to suit your specific needs.
